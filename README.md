## Mode of Execution Used <img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/S/streamlit-logo-1A3B208AE4-seeklogo.com.png" title="Streamlit" alt="Streamlit" width="40" height="40">

## Streamlit Server

- Streamlit is a python framework through which we can deploy any machine learning model and any python project with ease and without worrying about the frontend.<br>
- Streamlit is very user-friendly.<br>
- Streamlit has pre defined functions for all frontend components and we can directly use them.<br>
- To install streamlit in your system, just run this command-

```
pip install streamlit
```

## Running Project in Streamlit Server
<p>Make Sure all dependencies are already satisfied before running the app.</p>

1. We can Directly run streamlit app  with the following command-<br>
```
streamlit run app.py
```
where app.py is the name of file containing streamlit code.<br>

By default, streamlit will run on port 8501.<br>

Also we can execute multiple files simultaneously and it will be executed in next ports like 8502 and so on.<br>

2. Navigate to URL http://localhost:8501

You should be able to view the homepage of your app.

🌟 Project and Models will change but this process will remain the same for all Streamlit projects.<br>

## Deploying using Streamlit

1. Visit the official website of streamlit : <a href="https://streamlit.io/"><img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/S/streamlit-logo-1A3B208AE4-seeklogo.com.png" title="Streamlit" alt="Streamlit" width="40" height="40"></a> <br><br>
2. Now make an account with GitHub.<br><br>
3. Now add all the code in Github repository.<br><br>
4. Go to streamlit and there is an option for new deployment.<br><br>
5. Type your Github repository name and specify the file name. If you name your file as streamlit_app it will directly access it else you have to specify the path.<br><br>
6. Now also make sure you upload all your libraries and requirement name in a requirement.txt file.<br><br>
7. Version can also be mentioned like this python==3.9.<br><br>
8. When we mention version in the requirement file streamlit install all dependencies from there.<br><br>
9. If everything went well our app will be deployed on web and you can share the link and access the app from all browsers.
